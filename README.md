#### iPython_notebooks
I have just added my own project, the Consumer_Complaints_Mortgages notebook, an analysis of an API from [kaggle](www.kaggle.com) Enjoy checking out who the bad boys are in the mortgage business.  ;)

The Titanic notebook is from my [Udemy](www.udemy.com) course. It does not reflect my own code, although I did have to compensate for the Python2.7/Python3.4 discrepancy, since I'm using the more updated version. That was an adventure...
