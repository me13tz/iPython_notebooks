#### iPython_notebooks
I have just added my own projects, the Consumer_Complaints notebooks. Each is an analysis of an API from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). As the names would indicate, one is exclusively about mortgage complaints, the other covers three different financial products. Enjoy!

The Titanic notebook is from my [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) course. It does not reflect my own code, although I did have to compensate for the Python2.7/Python3.4 discrepancy, since I'm using the more updated version. That was an adventure...
